This repository contains a project for setting up and testing a Service Bus Emulator using Docker.

Prerequisites
•	Git
•	Docker Desktop

Getting Started

Follow the steps below to clone this repository, install Docker Desktop, and run the project.

Clone the Repository
1.	Open your terminal or command prompt.
2.	Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository:

cd /path/to/your/directory


	3.	Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/AkashTemburnikar/ServiceBusEmualtor.git


	4.	Navigate to the project directory:

cd ServiceBusEmualtor/ServiceBusEmualtorTest

Install Docker Desktop

Docker Desktop is required to run the emulator as a Docker container.
1.	Download Docker Desktop:
•	Visit the Docker Desktop Downloads Page.
•	Download the appropriate version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
2.	Install Docker Desktop:

	•	If Docker is installed, you will see the version number.

Run the Project with Docker

The project includes a compose.yaml file to set up the required services.
1.	Ensure Docker Desktop is running.
2.	Navigate to the project directory containing the compose.yaml file:

cd /path/to/ServiceBusEmualtor/ServiceBusEmualtorTest


	3.	Run the following command to start the services:

docker-compose up

This command will:
•	Pull the required Docker images (if not already present locally).
•	Build and start the containers defined in the compose.yaml file.

	4.	Verify the services:
	•	Open Docker Desktop to confirm the containers are running.
	•	Check the terminal logs to ensure there are no errors.

Stop the Services

To stop the running containers, use the following command:

docker-compose down

This command will stop and remove the containers but retain the Docker images for future use.
